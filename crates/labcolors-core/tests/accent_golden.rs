//! Contract 7 — AccentCurve / SentimentCurve golden snapshots.
//!
//! BUG CLASS this guards: *silent value drift.* Every other test in this crate
//! checks a *property* — in-gamut, monotone J', non-negative saturation, hits a
//! contrast target. None of them pins the *actual emitted colours*. A change to
//! a curve coefficient, the chroma envelope, the hue-optimisation search, or the
//! CAM16-UCS rescaling could shift every swatch by a few bytes while keeping all
//! the properties true — and no test would notice. The Bracket-path LUT seam
//! (#50/#53) was exactly this shape: a value that moved without a property
//! breaking. This file freezes the exact byte output of two representative
//! curves, sampled at 13 stops.
//!
//! A failure here is NOT automatically a bug: a deliberate recalibration of a
//! curve is a legitimate, intentional change of the snapshot. The rule is that
//! it must be a *conscious* swap — read the diff, confirm the new ladder is the
//! intended one, and update the constant. Drift that nobody chose is the
//! regression; the snapshot makes the difference visible instead of invisible.
//!
//! Snapshots captured 2026-06-12 from the curves' own `sample_hex(13)` through
//! their inherited (srgb) viewing conditions.
